/*
Channel is a data type in Go which provides synchrounization and communication between goroutines.
They can be thought of as pipes which is used by goroutines to communicate.
This communication between goroutines doesnâ€™t require any explicit locks.
Locks are internally managed by channel themselves.
Channel along with goroutine makes the go programming language concurrent
